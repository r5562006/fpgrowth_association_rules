# FP-Growth Algorithm for Association Rules

This project demonstrates the use of the FP-Growth algorithm to mine frequent itemsets and generate association rules. The script generates random data, applies the FP-Growth algorithm, and prints the resulting association rules.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `mlxtend`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fpgrowth_association_rules.git
    cd fpgrowth_association_rules
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the script to perform FP-Growth algorithm and generate association rules:
```sh
python fpgrowth_association_rules.py
